# Deployment Plan for SQL POCO Generator API

## Overview
The API is a .NET 9.0 WebAPI service that generates POCO classes from SQL Server databases. The deployment needs to be cost-effective while maintaining security and reliability.

## Recommended Deployment Strategy

### 1. Azure App Service (Basic B1)
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$13-15/month
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy deployment through Visual Studio or GitHub Actions
  - Built-in SSL/TLS
  - Auto-scaling capabilities if needed later
  - Easy configuration management
  - Integrated with Azure ecosystem
  - Supports both Windows and Linux hosting

### 2. Database Considerations
- Use Azure SQL Server (Basic tier)
  - **Estimated Cost**: ~$5/month
  - **Alternative**: If the API only generates POCOs and doesn't store data, you might not need a persistent database

### 3. Required Changes Before Deployment

#### Security
1. Update CORS policy to only allow specific origins:
```csharp
policy.WithOrigins("your-frontend-domain.com")
      .AllowAnyMethod()
      .AllowAnyHeader();
```

2. Add Authentication/Authorization if needed
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Move sensitive configuration to Azure Key Vault or App Service Configuration

#### Configuration
1. Update appsettings.json with environment-specific settings
2. Configure logging and monitoring
3. Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates

### 4. Deployment Process
1. Create Azure resources:
   - App Service Plan (B1)
   - App Service
   - (Optional) Azure SQL Database if needed

2. Configure CI/CD:
   - Set up GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline
   - Include automatic testing
   - Configure staged deployments (dev/prod)

3. Monitoring:
   - Enable Application Insights (free tier)
   - Set up basic alerts for errors and performance

### 5. Cost Optimization
- Use consumption plan for development/testing
- Configure auto-shutdown during non-business hours if applicable
- Monitor usage patterns and adjust resources accordingly
- Consider Azure Free Tier for development environment

### 6. Scaling Strategy
Start with B1 tier and monitor usage. Can easily scale up or out if needed:
- Vertical scaling: Upgrade to B2/B3 if more resources needed
- Horizontal scaling: Enable additional instances if load increases
